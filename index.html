                <h2>Dictionary Definition</h2>
               
                <p>Before I begin to define MY FAMILY, let's take a look at what the dictionary says a family is. According to Merriam-Webster, a family is <q>the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their children.</q></p>
                <p>I get it. I'm not mad at MW for defining it that way. For MANY years, my family kind of fit that definition perfectly. But honestly, that was only on the surface.</p>
            
                
                <h2>My Household</h2>
               
                <p>Like I mentioned above, my imediate family was a shining example of the dictionary definition. I grew up with a mom and dad, and 3 years into my life, a sister was added to our family. Mom, dad, and 2 kids, living in a 2-story house on a culdesac in the subrubs...</p>

            
                <h2>All the Cousins</h2>
                
                <p>Not only was my imediate family typical, but my extended family wasn't too crazy either. On my dad's side, I have 4 aunts, 4 uncles, and 8 cousins. On my mom's side, I have 3 aunts, 3 uncles, and 7 cousins. I even have a first-cousin, once-removed who is 20 years old. I have a huge family! And we still get together a couple of times a year for holidays and such.</p>

                <p class="imgCaption">A very simplified family tree showing my parents and their siblings!</p>
                </div>

                <p>That's an average family, right?!</p>

                <h3>*** BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!! ***</h3>

        
                <h2>Spoiler Alert: I'm Adopted!</h2>
        
                <p>So while my family looked typical from an ousider's perspective, you would be missing the fact that I was adopted at birth. So was my sister. Neither of us share genetic bonds to either of our parents. But they are still mom and dad, and that will never change!!</p>
                <p>The cool thing about my adoption, is that it was open. This meant that my parents were in contact with my birthmom throughout my life, and later on, I was in contact with her. First it was through snail mail, then emails, and then on Mother's Day, 2007, I called her first the first time. At this time, I didn't have any contact with my biodad, and really only knew that he was 1/2 Italian, which made me at least 1/4 Italian! (I played this up a LOT)</p>
                <p>My dad had already been in contact with her over the phone because they were planning for me to meet her for the first time that summer. High school was already being mean to me, so they thought meeting her would help me out!</p>
                <p>And meet her I did! That summer, her and my little brother Nate became a more permanent part of my life!! I also met more grandparents, an aunt and uncle, and a cousin! My family grew in quite a bit bigger in a matter of days. I know they were always my family, but meeting them made them officially a part of my life!</p>

                <h2>Long Lost Family</h2>
        
                <p>Many years went by, and many trips were made up to Iowa to spend time with Monica and her family! Even when I went off to college, I made sure to take trips up there to see them! My brother even came down to St. Louis a couple of the summers during my high school years, to attend the VBS that I volunteered at.</p>
                <p>During many of the trips, my birthmom and I would play detective and search out my biological father on the web. Multiple times, we landed on the same Facebook&reg; profile, and she was so sure it was him, but I was too chicken to reach out. That is until 2017... 10 years after I had met my birthmom, I finally got up the courage to message the man who might be the other half of my genetic code. According to Facebook messenger, I sent the message July 11, 2017.</p>
                <p>My message was extremely simple: <blockquote>My name is Rebecca, I was wondering if you possibly knew a woman by the name of Monica Wallukait? It would have been back around 1990.</blockquote></p>
                <p>Nearly 2 months later, on September 1, 2017, I received a reply.</p>
                <p><b>IT WAS HIM.</b></p>
                <p>I was honesly shaking, I even told him this. We talked for several days, and it was amazing! He confirmed that we are indeed Italian! It wasn't too long after that first conversation that we met in person.</p>

           
                <h2>Life Happened</h2>
         
                <p>Because nothing can happen when we want it to, a lot of my drama caught up with me, and that first visit with Ron, was the last one for a few years. I finally got up the courage to move back to St. Louis, but then had to stop traveling for a bit, to figure some things out. I was going through a divorce and other stuff, so staying still for a bit was my best option.</p>
                <p>My divorce just got finalized recently, and so I decided the first thing I wanted to do was get up to Iowa again! I happened to request some time off for my son's spring break, so it was perfect timing!</p>


                <h2>My Ever Growing Famliy</h2>
         
                <p>I have honestly left so much out of this page currently, but always love to share about my family "tree"! I hope to some day explain my family in a way that would make sense to people. Maybe I will turn this into a bigger project than a static page!</p>
                <p>I will leave you with a final diagram of what my famly looks like (not including grandparents or their connections).</p>
